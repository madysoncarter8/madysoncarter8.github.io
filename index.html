     <h2>About</h2>
     <p>A first-generation college student and self-taught video editor, Madyson Carter is 
    combining her creativity with her love of movies to develop her skills in video editing. From 
    Jacksonville, Florida, Madyson grew up in a movie and theme park loving household. The 
    childhood memories she made from these forms of media, inspired her to pursue a creative 
    career. She started editing Avengers movies at 14 using various iPhone apps, which started her 
    interest in editing. After starting at the University of Miami as a marine biology major, she has 
    rediscovered her love of video editing and is now pursuing a lifelong career in electronic media. In the span of a few months, Madyson 
    has taught herself how to use more sophisticated editing software like Premiere Pro and After 
    Effects, using the same movie footage her younger self did. She hopes to further develop these 
    skills over the next few years and work for a production company, making media that will make 
    more childhood memories like her own. </p>
