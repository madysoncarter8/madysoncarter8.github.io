    <h2>About</h2>

    <p>A first-generation college student and self-taught video editor, Madyson Carter is combining her creativity with her love of movies to develop her skills in video editing. From Jacksonville, Florida, Madyson grew up in a movie and theme park loving household. The childhood memories she made from these forms of media, inspired her to pursue a creative career. She started editing superhero movies at 14 using various iPhone apps, which started her interest in editing.</p>

    <p>After starting at the University of Miami as a marine biology major, she has rediscovered her love of video editing and is now pursuing a lifelong career in electronic media. Over the past month, Madyson has taught herself how to use more sophisticated editing software like Premiere Pro and After Effects, using the same movie footage her younger self did. She hopes to further develop these skills over the next few years and work for a production company, making media that will make more childhood memories like her own. </p>
